Researching Piotroski F-Score formation
-Determined he has a buy-and-hold for one year and re-evaluate based on F-score only strategy
-We will analyze differentiate a few different strategies on different types of regression
Started messing with visualization
-Performed a basic review of the circle graphics that was performed in HW4
-Updated the “data” to have industry examples linked to specific colors
-Will update to have “on-click” functionality to show more information associated with the F-Scores, industries, and specific companies
